Here are some Sample timing metrics available from a sampler response.
All times are in µs (1µs = 0.000001s).
{'timing': {
    'total_real_time': 827389,
    'qpu_access_overhead_time': 2487,
    'anneal_time_per_run': 20,
    'post_processing_overhead_time': 360,
    'qpu_sampling_time': 819800,
    'readout_time_per_run': 123,
    'qpu_delay_time_per_sample': 21,
    'qpu_anneal_time_per_sample': 20,
    'total_post_processing_time': 2185,
    'qpu_programming_time': 7589,

    'qpu_access_time': 827389,
    'qpu_readout_time_per_sample': 123
  }
}
If you want to know how much QPU time your operation will take, total,
calculate:
num_reads * (readout_time_per_run + qpu_delay_time_per_sample + qpu_anneal_time_per_sample)
In the above sample timing, the total QPU time was 827389µs for
5000 samples. That is 819800µs for the the samples, and 7589µs QPU overhead.
That is 163.96µs per sample, or (123µs + 21µs + 20µs) per sample.
So, the books balance.
Here is sample output from flipping 10 coins at a time.
QPU time is 0 because it was run with a simulated annealer.
Coin Flipperama!

Flip a bunch of coins and show the distribution.
How many coins do you want to flip at the same time? 10
Okay, for each trial I am going to flip 10 coins
and I will repeat this for 5000 trials.
Next, I will display a distribution of how many coins came up heads.
This is very exciting, don't you think?
DON'T BLINK!
QPU access time is not available. This makes me sad.
Whew! That was really tough. It took me     0.1940 seconds to flip 50000 coins.
Of all that time, the QPU was used for 0.00000000 seconds.
Give me a moment to sort out these results...
Ah, here we go. Here is your distribution for
the total number of heads per trial:
